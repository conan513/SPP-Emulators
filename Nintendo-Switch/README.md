yuzu is an experimental open-source emulator for the Nintendo Switch from the creators of [Citra](https://citra-emu.org/).

It is written in C++ with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for Windows and Linux. The emulator is capable of running several commercial games.

yuzu only emulates a subset of Switch hardware and therefore most commercial games **do not** run at full speed or are not fully functional.

Do you want to check which games are compatible and which ones are not? Please visit our [Compatibility page](https://yuzu-emu.org/game/)!

yuzu is licensed under the GPLv2 (or any later version). Refer to the license.txt file included.
