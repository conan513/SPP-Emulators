****************************************************************************
0.  Introduction
****************************************************************************

ePSXe is a Sony Playstation emulator for your PC running under 
Windows Vista+ or linux. It takes advantage of the popular PSEmu Pro 
plugin system.

****************************************************************************
1.  What's New?
****************************************************************************

ePSXe v2.0.5, released on 06.23.2016

- Updated the x86 recompiler to use the same recompiler than in the rest of 
  versions (Android, Linux x64, Mac ...). Now it should be easier to
  fix problems in all versions.

- Ported the local netplay from Android (Experimental). This version is 
  compatible using local netplay with the rest of ePSXe versions from the 
  version 2.0.5 (MacOSX, Linux x86, Linux x64 and Android - version 2.0.6).
  (Additional info the epsxe docs)

- Ported the GPUCORE threading mode from the Android version. The PC CPUs
  are faster than Android CPUs, so it will improve less FPS. (This
  option is better when the CPU is slower).

- Added new threading modes to the Pete OpenGL2 Core Plugin. It includes
  a basic 2-thread mode, and 2 extra modes adding soft/hardware effects.
  (It could improve some effects, for example the burning photo on the 
  start of Castlevania)

- In the INPUTCORE plugin, swapped the vibration actuators when using the
  Xinput mode (to match to real PSX Left/Right). Besides when using a 
  gamepad in digital mode, now you can use the left stick as the dpad.

- Fixed the >2GB PBP roms support. Now it should be able to run the PSX2PSP
  isos bigger than 2GB as Final Fantasy VIII PSP pack.

- Fixed the cheat codes support when running on the interpreter mode.

- Added a new option in the cheat codes window to download cheat codes from
  the ePSXe version (Thanks to psxdatacenter.com)

- Fixes to the core which made more games playable or better working.
     - WING COMMANDER IV
     - MONKEY HERO

3.2 Controlling the emulator

  ePSXe supports direct input and also features an option which allows you
  to configure the pads through the UI. It is very simple and intuitive :
  Click config -> game pads -> pad1/pad2 (the one you want to configure),
  and you will see a picture of a pad and some fields with the names of 
  the keys. Select the psx button what you want configure and then hit the 
  key you want to assign to it. (in case you want use a joystick, hit the 
  joystick button instead of a key).

  Starting with ePSXe 2.0 you can use a external input plugin like Pokopom.

  Starting with ePSXe 1.2.0 you can select the analog axis that you want to
  use, selecting the axis to configure and moving the axis in your joystick.
  You can also configure the effect that will be done in every motor
  in the force feedback.

  ePSXe includes 8 fast keys to use some options of the emu:

  - F1-Savestate in selected slot.
  - F2-Increase slot. (max = 5)
  - F3-Loadstate from selected slot.
  - F4-Enable/Disable Framelimit.
  - F5-Toggle Digital pad/Selected type of PSX pad.
  - F6-Select what pad will be affected by key F5.
  - F7-Swap on the fly the current GPU for the GPUCORE.
  - F8-Make a snapshot to snap directory.

3.4. Configuring the emulator.

Basically you need to configure the bios, your video card, CD-ROM drive,
your sound card and the input in order to get the emulator fully working.

For video, sound, cdrom and input, you can select the plugins from
config->Plugins. Using config->(video/sound/cdrom/gamepads) you can
directly access the selected plugin configuration. 

3.4.1. Configuring the bios.

In ePSXe, click config -> bios. In the new window, you can see a text box 
which shows the currently selected bios and a browse button. Click this button
and select the BIOS you want to use. During testing we found out that the 
scph1001.bin and scph7502.bin BIOS' are compatible, but the scph1000.bin won't
work. Please remember you may only be in possession of the copyrighted BIOS 
when you're legally entitled.

Starting  with ePSXe 1.9.25, an internal HLE bios is supported. The
compatibility is high but not the accuracy, the memcards could also not
work on some games.

3.4.2. Configuring the video options.

In ePSXe, click config -> plugins -> video. In the new window, you can see a dropdown 
menu which shows the currently selected video plugin(*). Select your favourite video 
plugin and click on the configure button, and, finally click ok.

ePSXe includes 2 internal GPU plugins (by default):
1) GPUCORE. It is a soft plugin ported from the android version. It uses opengl2
+ shaders to render. This plugin is very accurate and it supports a lot of
features such as increasing internal resolution, shaders, 2D filters and
brightness profiles ...

2) Pete OpenGL2 Core Plugin. It is Pete`s OGL2 plugin integrated in ePSXe. It
requires a good videocard (nvidia/ati), but it includes a wonderful bunch of
features to enhanced the graphics.

(*) EPSXE uses PSEmu Pro's video plugins, so you can get other compatible GPU
plugins from psxdatacenter.com


3.4.3. Configuring the CD-ROM

in ePSXe, select config -> plugins -> cdrom. In the new window, you can see a dropdown 
menu which shows the currently selected CD-ROM plugin(*). Select the plugin of your
choise and click on the "Configure" button afterwards. There's yet another dropdown
menu, in which you can select the drive letter of the CD-ROM you want to use. In case
you want to use your primary CD-ROM, just stay with the default entry. For using
another CD-ROM, just select the preferred drive and click on OK. We mainly tested
the emulator with the internal cdrom plugins, and with the Pete cdrom plugin.

Win2k users should use the win2k native CDR plugin, it worked fine
during our tests.

3.4.4. Configuring the sound.

In ePSXe, select config -> plugins -> sound. In the new window, you can see a dropdown 
menu which shows the currently selected sound plugin(*). Select the sound plugin of
your choise and click on the "Configure" button afterwards. In the appearing
window, there're several check boxes where you can enable disable certain
sound options. The playstation uses 3 different kind of sounds : ADPCM, XA
and CDDA.

* Enable Sound  (Select this to enable ADPCM sound) - Used to enable ADPCM
sound, and it is necessary to get XA sound.

(*) EPSXE can use PSEmu Pro's sound plugin system or an internal
    sound system. If you want to use psemu plugins you need download the
    plugins first. Recommeded are Pete, Eternal and the internal one.
    There is other very good like Andy and Iori plugins.

3.4.5. Configuring the input.

In ePSXe, select config -> plugins -> input port1/port2. In the new window, you can 
see a dropdown  menu which shows the currently selected input plugin(*). Select 
the input plugin of your choise and click on the "Configure" button afterwards. 

From ePSXe 2.0.0, it supports external input plugins as Pokopom.

3.4.6. Choosing MemoryCards files.

In this window, you can select the memory cards files what you want to use.
ePSXe supports the most important memory cards formats, .MC(R), .GME, .MCD
and .MEM. You can disable/enable the memcards from this windows if you need to
do it.

Epsxe by default use 2 shader memcards for all games, but there is a option to
force to use 2 individual memcards by game.

3.5. Command line options.

3.6. Memory cards support.

ePSXe also comes along with memory card support. The used cards are saved
in 2 files in your \memcards directory. The first one is named epsxe000.mcr 
and the second one epsxe001.mcr. Each file has a size of 128 KB (which is
PSX standard), and the format is simply a dump of real memory cards.

ePSXe doesn't come with a memory card editor, but you can use the option
Load -> Run BIOS to get to the real PSX memory card editor, from where
you can delete / move savegames. In case you're using Pete's OpenGL / D3D
plugins, don't forget to enable offscreen rendering to see this menu 
correctly.

ePSXe 1.0.1 includes a memory card file selector, so you can select which file
you want to use in which slot. ePSXe also has support for different memory card
file supports, like Dexdrive (.gme), PSEmu Pro (.mc) and several others.

3.7. Savestates.

ePSXe 1.2.0 supports savestates. They are files that
contain the state of the emulator when the key was hit, so you
can restore to the state later in that same exact point.

F1 = Save the state to the slot selected
F2 = Increase the slot. (If you use the on fly menus
in gpu plugins you can see the slot selected)
(MAX = 5 slots)
F3 = Load the state of the slot selected

ePSXe 1.2.0, 1.4.0   supports savestates version 0.
ePSXe 1.5.0          supports savestates version 0 and 1.
ePSXe 1.6.0          supports savestates version 0, 1 and 2.
ePSXe 1.7.0          supports savestates version 0, 1, 2 and 3.
ePSXe 1.8.0, 1.9.25  supports savestates version 0, 1, 2 and 3.
ePSXe >=2.0.0        supports savestates version 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.

ePSXe for Windows/Linux supports the savestates done by Android
and vice versa.

3.8. Netplay plugins.

ePSXe 1.4.0 supports netplay plugins. To select the plugin
you should use the option config->netplay. Read the
docs included in the netplugin pack.

3.9. Cheat Codes.

ePSXe supports GameShark cheat codes. You can load cheat codes in the
emulator creating a file called "cheats/SXXX_XXX.XX.txt"
(where SXXXX_XXX.XX is the PS-EXE name of the game, which you can see
enabling the ePSXe Log Console).
For example in Final Fantay 8 US-NTSC the file name is:

"cheats/SLUS_008.92.txt".

ePSXe supports until 256 codes per file. The file format is:

#description of cheat code 1
XXXXXXXX YYYY
ZZZZZZZZ AAAA
#descripion of cheat code 2
NNNNNNNN MMMM

For example for Final Fantasy 8 US-NTSC, it could be "cheats/SLUS_008.92.txt":

#Zell level 20
800778a4 4a38

Currently, only 80XXXXXX, 30XXXXXX, 50XXXXXX, 1F800XXX, 0XXXXXX, 11XXXXXX, 
20XXXXXX, 21XXXXXX gameshark codes are supported, the rest will be ignored.
You can find GameShark codes in a lot of webpages in internet, like:
http://psxdatacenter.com
http://www.gamegenie.com/cheats/gameshark/ps1/index.html
After that, re-load your game, and you will be able to enable/disable the
gameshark codes from the menu "cheat codes" on gameplay (the codes are 
disabled by default).

Other way to get cheat codes working is download PEC
(http://pec.emucheater.com) for in game cheating.

3.10. Local netplay support (experimental)

From the version 2.0.5, ePSXe supports local netplay without using external
plugins. This feature is compatible with the rest of ePSXe ports (MacOSX,
Linux, Android ...). In order to play you need the same bios in both devices,
and the same games in both devices. In order to find the game, this game have
to be available in the gamelist feature in both devices. 

How to use:

Player1:

1) File>Local netplay>Player1
2) Select the game from the gamelist and press run
3) You can see your local IP address in the console, it will be necessary in 
   player2 to connect.
4) Wait to the game to start.

Player2:
1) File>Local netplay>Player2
2) Insert the local IP address from the player1
3) Wait to the game to start

When using this feature, it will use isolated memcards by game stored in the
folder epsxe/memcards/net/ in the player1, and it will get synched in the
same folder in the player2.

It is possible to load savestates in the player1, and it will be sent by
net to the player2.

*******************************************************************************
5.  Compatibility in EPSXE
*******************************************************************************

Compatibility in ePSXe hasn't been tested that much yet, actually it has been
mainly tested with PAL games. Current compatibility percentage is superior
at 95%.

Some games known to work are:

- Colin McRae Rally 1 and 2
- Crash Bandicoot 1, 2 and 3
- Driver 1 and 2
- Fifa 99/2000.
- Final Fantasy VII, VIII and IX
- Iss98, Isspro evolution

- NBA Live 2000, and 2001
- Need For Speed III, IV, V
- Ridge Racer
- Ridge Racer type 4
- Soulblade
- Syphon Filter 1, 2
- Tekken 1, 2 and 3
- Tigger Woods 99, 2000
- Tomb Raider 1, 2, 3 and 4
- Vagrant Story
- Xenogears
- Valkyrie Profile
- and many more ...

Once you start a game in ePSXe various things can occur:

   - The game works correctly.
       Solution: "Be happy !" :) Send us a screenshot when you're
       through the game.

   - The game works but you get graphics problems.
       Solution : ePSXe uses the PSEmu Pro plugins to draw the graphics to
       your screen, so you could try a different plugin.

   - The game works but you get 3d graphics or light problems.
       Solution:  ePSXe has a more or less complete GTE emulation, but
       several GTE opcodes are still very buggy :-(. Wait for the  next
       version. You can also try another plugin to make sure it's really
       a GTE problem (Pete's soft GPU plugin is very very compatible !)

   - The GAME still won't work.
       Solution:  If, after all, the game STILL won't work, than it's most
       propably simply not compatible with ePSXe right now. You should wait
       for the next version of the emulator. 

Sound.

   ePSXe comes with support for the PSEmu Pro sound plugins in this version.
   This includes ADPCM, CDDA and partial XA sound.  Common problems
   with the sound:

   - The game plays no sound at all
       Solution: Check the sound settings in the menu.

   - XA sound playback is jerky.
       Solution: You need 50/60 fps in order to get accurate sound.

  centering (Star Ocean 2, Jumping Flash 2, Hogs of War...), fixed some
  gargabe on the borders when changing the resolution, fixed a scrolling
  problem, fixed a screen ratio problem when changing from windowing to
  fullscreen on the fly, added vsync support, and added support to select the
  blitter as OpenGL2 or OpenGL1 (it should be compatible with some old
  videocards, but shader support is not supported in OpenGL1 mode).

- Improved the openGL2 plugin. Fixes Xmen Mutant Academy 1 & 2, Nascar
  Thunder 2002/2003/2004, Pro Pinball - Big Race Usa, Pro Pinball - TimeShock,
  Pro Pinball Fantastic Journey and Worms Pinball (use framebuffer effects=0

ePSXe v2.0, released on 02.17.2016

- First of all, ePSXe 2.0 now requires Windows Vista or superior. While 
  it could work on Windows XP SP3, it has not been tested.

- Multi-language support. This is the first ePSXe release officially supporting
  multiple languages. Currently there is support for English, Spanish, Japanese
  (thanks to Nekokabu) and Italian (thanks to Domus). If you want to help us
  translate the emulator to other language let us know at epsxepc@gmail.com.

- Added a gamelist window. Now you can open a gamelist window by selecting
  File->Open Gamelist or clicking on the letters "PSX" from the ePSXe logo.
  From this window you can select the folders to scan and click on refresh to
  create a gamelist with the games found in the those folders. Additionally you
  can get the mini-icon covers for the games in the gamelist. There is also
  support for multi-PBP files and ECM files.

- Improved CPU accuracy. Dynarec and the interpreter accuracy has been improved
  fixing some possible corner cases. The main goal of the dynarec is performance,
  so it is less accurate than the interpreter mode.

- Adjusted overall timing. The FPS and Mhz have been adjusted to match the real
  PSX on NTSC and PAL. It helps synchronization in some games such as Bust a
  Groove 1 & 2 during songs (those games requires low sound latency).

- Improved GTE support. The GTE accuracy has been improved to match the
  Android version. In addition this version support 2 hacks for the GTE.
  Widescreen support which is used to stretch the screen to 16:9 without
  modifying the aspect of 3D objects. Given it is a hack it will fail in some
  games, especially those combining 2D and 3D.
  Subpixel precision (gte accuracy hack thanks to Edbla) which allows more
  precision to be kept through computations but requires a gpu renderer
  supporting this feature.

- Ported the Soft GPU from the Android version. The new GPU Core requires
  a videocard supporting OpenGL2 + GLSL shader. It is a very accurate soft GPU,
  supporting features such as:
    - Increased internal resolution at x2 and x4. (very fast CPU required for x4)
    - Brightness profiles, to increase the brightness in dark games.
    - Stretching modes: 4:3, stretching or widescreen
    - 2D filters: 2xSai, xBRZ (thanks to Zenju)
    - Shaders: FXAA/CRT-Lottes (thanks to Lottes), CRT-Hyllian/xBR-LV2-3D (thanks
      to Hyllian)
    - Simple custom Shaders (a pack with examples is available on epsxe.com/files)
    - Scanlines suport
    - Removing of top/bottom black bands in some games.
    - Sub-pixel precision (or gte accuracy hack).
  (Special thanks to Pete Bernert :)

- Included the Pete Opengl2 GPU core. It is the Pete OGL2 gpu core included in
  the ePSXe Core. This version is the actual Pete OGL2 plugin supporting a 
  sub-pixel precision (or gte accuracy hack), memory detection and fix the game
  Guardian Recall. Millions of thanks to Pete Bernert, Tapcio and Edbla. 

- Teamviewer incompatibility is resolved with the internal GPU plugins. The GPU
  Core and Pete Opengl2 GPU core are not affected by the incompatibility with
  the TeamViewer software.

- Added a configuration window to select options for the internal SPU Plugin.
  Currently it is possible to select the sound latency (normal or very low -
  required on Bust a Groove 1 & 2) and enable/disable some sound effects
  (filters and reverb).

- Fixed support for CDDA music in external SPU plugins.

- Improved the internal input plugin. Improved multitap to support a lot of games
  that did not work in the previous versions. Added support to autofire. Now you
  can select up to 4 buttons for player-1 and player-2 as autofire, and
  configure the repeat frequency by button.

- Added support for Konami Justifier gun using the mouse for games such as Die
  hard Trilogy, Area 51, Lethal Enforcers, Crypt Killer, Project - Horned Owl,
  Lethal enforces I & II.

- External Input plugins support. This version supports external input plugins
  such as Pokopom. You can select a plugin for the Port 1 and Port 2, but it is
  recommended that if you want use both an external plugin and the internal
  plugin you select the external plugin in the first port. Thanks to Shalma.

- Added game profile by game. In this version it is possible during the gameplay
  to save your preferences for the current game. The next time that you run the
  same game it will use those preferences. All internal settings in every
  plugin included with the emulator are supported (spucore, gpucore and Pete
  Opengl2 GPU Core).

- Improved auto-PPF support. Now the PPFv3 version is supported, and it is
  possible to auto-load up to 8 PPFs per game. The filenames used must be
  "(PS-EXE-ID)-00", "(PS-EXE-ID)-01". Ex: SLPS_013.00-00, SLPS_013.00-01.

- Improved cheat support. Fixed cheatcodes gameshark conditional, added
  increment/decrement types (0x10-11, 0x20-21) and copy type (0xc2).

- Improved HLE bios emulation. Starting with version 1.9.25, the HLE bios has
  been improved to support more games: Wild Arms, Jet Moto, Toca World Touring,
  Simcity 2000. Memcards support was improved for a lot of games such as
  Dinocrisis 2, Metal Gear Solid, V-Rally2, Diablo, Ridge Racer Type 4, Driver,
  Echo Night and Azure Dreamns.

- Added HLE bios support (an official PS1 is recommend yet). From this
  version ePSXe can run ps1 games without an official PS1 bios, it includes
  HLE bios emulation. Support is limited, but it is good enought to run a
  very high number of games.
  VERY IMPORTANT: Savestates done with a official PS1 bios are NOT compatible 
  with savestates done with ePSXe HLE bios (Besides it uses a different namespace).

- Fixed multi-bin format in Windows version (redump format). Now it supports
  the games saved in multiple bins files + cue file directly.

- Better SBI subchannel support (for example in Medievil) and fixed SBI in games 
  with ECM format. Added SBI support in MDS/MDF format.

- Added support to save memcards by game. Enabling this option it will
  create 2 memcards by everygame in memcards/games/ folder, using the serial
  of the game. In multidisc games, it will share the same memcards by all
  of discs.

- Fixes to the CD-ROM decoder and the core which made almost 20 more games
  playable or working better like. For example this fixed
  - Arcade Party Pak: Rampage now works
  - Crash Bash: Pause menu now works
  - Final Fantasy V
  - Junclassic C.C. & Rope club
  - Kamen Rider v3

  some games like Tomb Raider Chronicles or Metal Gear Solid. Usage execute 
  epsxe.exe -dmachaincore. 

- Note: for information about compatibility and games's configuration,
  it is recommended that you visit the "Playstation Datacenter" at
  http://psxdatacenter.com/. We want to thank Gladiator and Angel who 
  have been a very important help in betatesting the new version.

ePSXe v1.9.0, released on 26.07.2013

- Added support for more types of Gameshark cheat codes. (D0-D3, E0-E3).

- Added support for multi-bin iso format (redump format), and preliminary
  support for ECM iso format.

- The internal SPU plugin has been updated to the 1.9.0 version. It includes
  fixes on interpolation (Square games) and other minnor fixes (Kururin Pa!).

- Added support for joysticks with Circle analog Range. Choose "Full Circle"
  on the kind of analog on configure gamepad screen. (Logitech and Xbox
  gamepads).

- Fixed analog full range to -128,127. (Ape Escape)

- Fixes to the CD-ROM decoder and the core which made almost 30 more games
  playable or working better like. For example this fixed TempestX3,
  Duke Nukem Land of Babes, Rayman, Kiganjo,
  Kids Station - Motto! Oja Maho Doremi Dokkan! Maho Dou Eigo Festival,
  Firo & Klawd, Stahlfeder ...

ePSXe v1.8.0, released on 09.11.2012

- Added cheat codes support. Now ePSXe support Gameshark cheat codes. See
  the Cheat Code section below to get information on how to use it.

- Added support for disc images in PBP format. It supports compressed images, and
  multi-disc images (a list of images is shown when you choose a multi-disc pbp).
  This doesn't support encrypted files.

- Added subchannel support using SBI files from redump.org. To get it working 
  with isos the SBI file has to be renamed with the same filename as the image 
  (except the extension, for example .bin to .sbi) and be located in the same folder.
  To get it working in cdroms, you need to put the SBI file in directory patches,
  with the PS-EXE name of the game and ".sbi" at the end of the name.
  (example: SLES_99.999.SBI). Be carefull, ".sub" has priority over ".sbi",
  so if you prefer to use the ".sbi" file, remove/move ".sub" to another folder.

- Fixed changedisc feature, which was broken in 1.7.0, and added fixes to
  support changedisc in more games that were not previously working.

- The internal SPU plugin has been updated to the 1.8.0 version. This
  version includes multiples fixes and add compatibility with a lot of
  sound effects that were not properly supported before. Thanks goes to 
  Shalma and Tikalat.  The following games work better in this release: 
  Um Jammer Lammy, Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy Tactics, Xenogears, 
  Vagrant Story, Misadventures of Tron Bonne, Spyro 2 & 3, Vib Ribbon, 
  Discworld Noir, Tales of Destiny, Extreme Ghostbuster, 
  South Park Chef's Luv Shack, Silhouette, Thousand Arms, Adidas Power Soccer ...

- Added better support to change memcards on the fly (Dragon Warrior 7,
  Star Ocean 2, Valkyrie Profile ...). This includes a
  better detection by the games. You can also disable the memcards
  in the configuration screen (needed in Lifeforce Tenka). Thanks goes to
  Shalma and Tikalat.

- Improved dual shock, mouse, guncon, multitap emulation (vibration on
  multitap not supported). Mouse is working again in the Pad2 (Quake), 
  and multitap is working in more games like Frogger 2, Rampage 2 and 
  Crash Bash.  Thanks goes to Shalma and Tikalat.

- Better support for CDDA in games, more games which had CDDA in the
  previous version work now. It also adds better RepPlay, and
  AutoPause support.

- Some games with GPU status problems are detected and auto-activate the
  required options in the GPU. These games don't work if you use PEC.
  The list of affected games includes: To heart, Ishin No Arashi,
  Dukes hazzard Racing for Home, Hot wheels: turbo racing, U.P.P.
  Thanks goes to gladiator.

- Added support for savestates in some game which didn't work in the previous
  version because it was unable to find the game code name. It now generates 
  a game code name for the game like SLU_XX.XXX.

- Fixes to the CD-ROM decoder and the core which made almost 150 more games
  playable or working better like. For example this fixed Shaman king, 
  Arcade Pack (Rampage), Virtual Pool 3, Heart of Darkness, Eldergate,
  Blue's Clues - Blue's Big Musical, Carnage Heart EZ,
  Simple 1500 Series Vol 006 - The hanafuda, Roswell Conspirancies - Level 7,
  Armored Core - Master of Arena, Digital Figure Iina, My Dream / On Air...

  been a very important help in betatesting the new version.

ePSXe v1.7.0, released on 24.05.2008

- Multiple changes has been done in the Pad support. This version supports
  the Axis LRX, axis with +/-/full ranges, and a important bug in vibration
  support has been fixed avoiding crashes. In the sio emulation section,
  this version includes better DualShock protocol support, including
  vibration in more games, and adding 2 new pad types, "DualAnalog" and
  "Negcon". Finally thanks to the new Pete's gpu plugins, a new type of
  "visual vibration" has been included, shaking the image when the
  game triggers a vibration effect. (Note: if you are using epsxe 1.6.0
  or older, it could be necessary to reconfigure the pad plugin in this
  new version).

- The internal SPU plugin has been updated to the 1.7.0 version. This
  version includes new effects like better envelope, noise, interpolation,
  frequency modulation, reverb and better synchronization between the core
  and the sound. Thanks to this last fix, the following games work better now:
  Metal Gear Solid, Valkyrie Profile, Eithea. Besides the spu API now
  includes support for CDDA playing, getting better CDDA sound and core
  synchronization, and compatibility with Vib Ribbon.

- In this new version, the iso support code has been rewritten. Now it supports
  the formats BIN/CUE, BIN/CCD and MDS/MDF (and minor fixes to ISO/NRG
  support). Besides, due to the changes in the internal spu plugin, now
  the CDDA sound is supported even when you run a iso game.
  Advice!!!: The files BIN/CUE, BIN/CCD must have the same name and
  different extension or the games will not be loaded

- The MDEC decoder has been rewritten in the new version to get
  new games playable suach as Area 51, Novastorm, Eggs of Steel 
  and Maximum Force. It also fixes other minor bugs in other games 
  like Rayman and Metal Gear Solid SM.

- In 1.7.0, thanks to Pete's help and his gpu plugins, the framelimit 
  management has been changed. Now the framelimit is always
  enabled on startup and it can be toggled on/off with the F4 key.
  It is recommended that you update your GPU plugins to the
  version that will be released around the epsxe release date.

- In this new version, a new version of the Pete's Software Plugin is
  included in the plugins directory with the name "gpu.data. With the
  F7 key it is possible change on the fly between the selected gpu
  plugin and that gpu soft plugin. The software plugin "gpu.dat" can
  be configured in the GPU plugin configuration screen with the 3
  bottom buttons.

- The XA/CDDA support has been worked in this new version, fixing sound
  problems in the following games: Gamera 2000, The Putter Golf, Silverload,
  The Firemen 2 Pete & Danny, Iron & Blood - Warriors of Ravenloft,
  Chronicles of the Sword.

- Fixes to the CD-ROM decoder and the core, which made at least 50 more games
  playable like, for example, Brigandine, Need for Speed 1, Harry Potter I&II, 
  Danger Girl, Wacky Races, Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor, Shadow Madness,
  London Seirei Tantei-Dan, Monsters SA, Equestrian Showcase, Black Down,
  Paca Paca Passion 1/2/special, This is football 2, Formula 1 EA 2000,
  Winnie the Pooh, Formula one 99/2000/2001/arcade, Gegere No Kitarou,

ePSXe v1.6.0, released on 05.08.2003

- Fixed some cdrom emulation regressions, and more accurate cdrom emulation.
  Gran Turismo 2, Dance Dance Revolution series, Gear Fighter Deboh, 
  Hokuto no Ken, Gundam Battle Assault 2.

- Changes to cdrom emulation what does that modchips games works. 
  It includes Legend of Dragon US, Winning Eleven 2002, Um Jammer Lammy,
  Omega Boost JAP, Wild Arms 2nd Ignition JAP, Saga Frontier 2 JAP,
  Chocobo Racing JAP and possibly others.

- Added support for autopause when playing CDDA sound. It should fix the
  problems with music in games like Tomb Raider I.

- Added support for report mode when playing CDDA sound. It fixes 
  tekken 1 music and Lemmings 3D. (if you have problems with this change
  it can be disabled with the commandline -disablereportmode).

- Fixed some problems reading subchannel. (Harvest Moon)

- Minnor changes to change disc function. (Arc the lad 3)

- Now the memcards are autosaved on the fly. It should solve the
  problem of lost your memcards if the emulator crashes on gameplay.
  (Remember that it is a good idea, to backup your memcards sometimes)

- Added gun emulation using a mouse. (Time Crisis 1, 2)

- Now the mouse emulacion can be selected in the second gameport, anyway
  only 1 mouse is supported yet, so if you do enable it, it will be
  disabled in the first pad.

- It is possible now select analog, digital and disabled mode in every gamepad. 
  (Thanks to everybody who helped testing it :)

- Included multitap support. In this version only 1 multitap is 
  supported. If you select multitap, it will support 4 gamepads, what
  will be connected to the first gameport of the psx. Multitap only
  must be enabled in games what supports it, in the rest of the games
  will not work the gamepads if multitap is enabled.

- The keys F5 and F6 have in the new version a different function. F6 is
  used for select a pad, and F5 will toggles digital/analog mode in the 
  pad selected. (you need upgrade your gpu plugins to 1.73 or superior)

- The dos window what shows the info messages, can be enabled/disabled from GUI.

- Included support for CDI isos. (Discjuggler format)

- Fixes to the CD-ROM decoder and the core, which made some more games
  playable like, for example, Spyro 2 PAL, Spyro 3 PAL, Front Mission 3,
  Batman Gothan City Racer, Duke Nukem: Land of babes, Ridge Racer JAP,
  Nekketsu Oyako, Bust a Grove 2 JAP ...

ePSXe v1.5.2, released on xx.05.2002

- Fixed a bug which got into 1.5.2 regarding several gte flags 
  (Porsche Challenge, Tomb Raider).

- Partially rewrote the CD-ROM decoder, now it doesn't need custom flags 
  in order to run various games any more.

- Moved the subchannel read options to it's own window in the CD-ROM 
  configuration. Also added a new subchannel reading mode, which works 
  with various LG 852x cdrom drives.

- Fixed a bug in the internal SPU plugin, which has been there since v1.5.0! 
  It caused sound effects to repeat and several games to freeze 
  (BOF series, Soul Blade).

- Added support for the Nero ISO format (.nrg).

- Massive changes to the SIO emulation. It should have better timing now and 
  the F4 trick shouldn't be necessary that often any more. "SIO irq always on" 
  has been removed from the GUI, but you can still turn it on using the F4 
  key. (affects Silent Hill esp, Track & Field, Metalslugx, NFS5 PAL, Rapshody ...)

- Fixed a bug in the internal ISO reading routines, which prevented some of the 
  last sectors to be accessed.

- As the Chrono Cross trick isn't necessary any more, we have assigned a new 
  trick to the F7 key, for the Xenogears dreams sequence: Press this key at 
  the beginning of the scene, and once again after the end ;)

- Fixes to the CD-ROM decoder and the core, which made some more games 
  playable like, for example, Theards of Fate, NBA Basketball 2000, 
  Legend of Mana, Rebelt Assault 2, Tekken 2, MegamanX series, 
  Jackie Chan US, Michelin Rally Masters, Transformers Beast of Wars ...

ePSXe v1.5.1, released on xx.03.2002

- Included partial support for libcrypt games. Libcrypt is a protection
  scheme used very often in PAL games. It uses data in subchannel Q.
  In order to play your original cd games in ePSXe you need a cdrom reader
  which works with the read-subchannel routines in ePSXe. NOT every cdrom
  reader with support for read subchannels will work in epsxe. If your cdrom
  reader is able to read subchannels but it is not supported by ePSXe,
  you can use clonecd to read the subchannel to a .SUB file, and copy it
  in the epsxe\patches directory with the same name than cdrom PS-EXE
  and with the extension .SUB (SLESXXX.XX.SUB/SCESXXX.XX.SUB/SLUSXXX.XX.SUB..)
  Since reading from subchannel is slow, ePSXe includes an option in the
  cdrom config window that you can enable to cache the subchannel to disk
  the first time you run a game. Of course you can always use some external
  cdrom plugins, currently only Pete's cdrom plugin supports it.
  (The support is partial because NO every libcrypt game is working :(,
  the no working games includes (at least) Spyro 2 and 3 PAL, and
  formula one 99) 
 
  In resumen:

  1) If you want subchannel support only from files, select in the cdrom config 
     window "Enable subchannel support".

  2) If you want subchannel support from cdrom, select in the cdrom config window
     "Enable subchannel support" and 
     "Enable subchannel read from cdrom."
     If your cdrom is able to read subchannels in epsxe, a message will be
     shown in the console between the rest of init messages.

  3) If you want to caching to disk the subchannel the first time what you
     run a game, select in the cdrom config window:
     "Enable subchannel support", 
     "Enable subchannel read from cdrom." and
     "Enable subchannel caching to disk."

  4) If you have problems reading the cdroms after of select
     "Enable subchannel read from cdrom." probably your cdrom is not compatible
     with ePSXe subchannel read routines, disable this option, and make your
     own .sub files with CloneCD.

- Added support for Teac cdrom readers to internal cdrom plugins.
  (Thanks to Pete)

- Added support for pov hat joysticks.
  (Thanks to Roberto Paredes by multiples tests)

- Some CD stuff got fixed, like the problem with changing discs, the 
  internal win2k CD plugin CDDA problems and a bug with the ppf support of 
  the internal plugins.

- Fixes to the GTE, which solve problems with 102 Dalmatinas, Rugrats in
  paris, Destruction Derby 2, Nuclear Strike and possibly others.

- Changed some internal timing stuff, which should produce better (faster)
  background sound in several games (FF7, Threads of Fate, Valkyrie Profile)
  (You can use the old timing with -oldtiming)

- Removed the auto detection of game and required BIOS, as this prevented
  Legend of the dragoon US and Wild Arms 2 US from working.

- Removed the two options -cdinc and -nocdinc, as fixes made them 
  unncessary. In this version -noxaread has not some effect.

- Added support for MDEC transparency, for the Oddworld series, dw4/dw7 
  battle effects. 

- Added support for Capcom MDECs, but you need to use the command line
  -adjustiming, what will give serious problems with gamepad keys and
  memory cards (use F4 to fix this problems), and hard slowdowns.
  (Use this option in your own risk, we recommend to use it only when
  it will be really necessary).

- Included a new commandline, it is called -nocdoverwrite. It could fix
  problems with some games like Parappa the Rapper's demo. Sometimes
  it does the same than -cdtiming.

- LINUX version only: added partial support for external gamepad plugins.
  Actually only works the lamer0's plugin, what is combined with the
  internal pad plugin.

- Fixes to CPU and CD-ROM make games like Star Wars - The phantom Menace,
  Resident Evil 1 PAL, Legend of Legaia, Star Ocean 2, Gran Turismo JAP and
  Philisoma playable.

ePSXe v1.5.0, released on xx.01.2002

- Fixed a bug in MDECs, which caused Metal Gear Solid and Rayman 1 to 
  crash. Furthermore, the MDEC options aren't read from the windows 
  registry any more, so you can only disable them with command lines 
  from now on.

- Rewritten the code what loaded the ps-exe files when starting a game, for 
  a better detection of the games name and the region.

- Added native support for ppf files. Now you don't need to patch the games 
  any more, simply copy your ppf file into the directory "/patches", with 
  the same name than the main PS-exe file in the cdrom (SLES*,SCES*,
  SLUS* ...), in uppercase. ePSXe will load it on startup then and patch 
  the game in memory on the fly !

- MCI code is now disabled in WinNT/2k/XP, expect when you are using an 
  external CD-ROM plugin which has its own CDDA functions (e.g. Pete's). 
  Furthermore, the external CD-ROM plugins can now play some games like 
  Tomb Raider I and II PAL, what was not possible before due to a bug 
  in 1.4.0.

- Fixed a bug in the internal CD-ROM plugins, which caused some games to 
  hang when they played CDDA sound and later accessed a data 
  sector (Rayman 1)

- Fixed some bugs in savestates. New savestate are not compatibles with old 
  epsxe versions, but the savestates from a savestate from an old version 
  can still be loaded. The command line -ssv0 has been added, which 
  will let ePSXe save the savestates into the old (but buggy) format. 
  (Fixed savestates in square mdecs, and in threads of fate)

- Some games which ran only with a certain bios version, should now run 
  with any (only checked with Legend of Dragon PAL)

- Fixed some GTE bugs. (Looney Tunes: Perro y Lobo, Nhl 99)

- Included a file with help, what can be accessed from help->contents.
  (Thanks to Bobbi)

- Last hour changes in internal spu, what fixes Metal gear solid and
  Valkyrie profile sound, but we have not had too time for test it ;)

- Added a new workaround in order to run Parasite Eve 2 (thanks to 
  Psychojak!). You need to use the command "-pe2". Some PE2 versions are 
  automaticly detected and don't need it though. We didn't play through 
  the complete game though, we can't tell if it's playable until the end.

- Fixes to the CD-ROM decoder and the core, which make some more games 
  playable like for example Valkyrie profile, Syphon filter series speech, 
  Rayman 1, Micromachines V3, Croc 2, Duke Nukem: Land of Babes, Vrally 2 
  and Nfs 5 menus, Time Crisis 2 music, Casper Around the World ...

- Multiples games can be played using additional commands like: 
  Rebelt Assault 2 (-noignorecmd), Micromaniacs (-cdtiming), 
  Front Mission 3 (-nocdinc) ...

ePSXe v1.4.0, released on  xx.06.2001

- Included a new wizard guided config, what should do easier
  configure the emulator.

- Fixed a bug in the internal sound plugin which caused
  crash on systems using directx8+geforce and some soundcards.

- Fixed a division by zero bug in the gte routines that started
  in version 1.2.0. It solves the problems with Xenogears,
  Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy 7.

- Added the extension .img (clonecd) to the load iso function.

- Fixed a bug detecting the name of some games, it is used
  to detect the format (pal/ntsc). (Metal Gear Solid Pal)

- Fixed a bug in the function CDROpen. Fix the psemupro iso plugin.

- Added support to the cdplayer included in the playstation
  bios, you can listen to your cdda with epsxe now :)

- Fixed some problems with the bootstrap of the playstation.
  -nogui should not be needed anymore. (Destruction Derby Raw pal,
  Breath of fire 3)

- Fixed some gte problems. (Vandal hearts 2 pal, Wipeout series)

- Fixed a mdec decoder bug. (Xfiles)

- Added preliminary support for netplay plugins. (Cyberpad)

- Now it is possible to change the memcards file in any moment of the
  game. (Of course you shouldn't change the memcard while the
  game is writing it, like in a psx ;-)

- Fixed some problems with the change disc function. (Metal Gear Solid)

- Included support for a new feature included in the video plugins,
  it now shows a mini-picture from the savestates when you use the
  F2 key to increase the selected save slot. (It works only with
  savestates done with the version 1.4.0 or superior)

- Fixed some problems with the XA sound effects and background
  XA sound which fix Silent Bomber, Megaman X5, Castlevania SOTN,
  Bloody Roar 1, Dinocrisis 2, and more.

- Fixes to the CD-ROM decoder and the core, which make some more games
  playable like for example Incredible Crisis, Simpsons Wresting,
  Threads of fate, Tomb Raider I and II (pal),
  Fighting Force 2 and so on ;)

ePSXe v1.2.0, released on 07.03.2001

- Added better analogic pad emulation and force feedback.
  It is now possible to configure the analogic axis and
  the effect of the force feedback motors. (Many thanks
  to Alex7 and to www.burutter.com, for donating a very nice
  psx to usb pad converter and giving help on adding support
  for it).

- Now ePSXe includes savestates support. F1 = save state,
  F2 = increase slot (max = 5), F3 = load state. The
  savestates are compressed and saved to the sstates directory,
  with an average size of 1.5Mb.
  (WARNING!!! In release date it is supported only in the
  following plugins: Lewpy Gpu, Pete Gpu, Pete Spu and ePSXe Spu,
  support will be included in more plugins soon
  by the plugins authors)

- Partially re-writen the internal spu, it should be
  faster, have less sound glitches and better sound quality.

- Optimizations added in gte, mdec and core which makes
  some games work some fps faster than before.

- Fixes to the CD-ROM decoder and the core, which make some more games
  playable like for example Gran Turismo, Resident Evil, Ape Escape,
  Kingley Adventure, Legend of Legaia (use the "-legaia" command line),
  Final Fantasy IX PAL and so on ;-)

ePSXe v1.0.1, released on xx.xx.2000

- A completly re-written MDEC engine, which should give you better quality
  and some more FPS during video playback.
- More accurate timing, what means that videos should pause less. (MDEC
  timing should always be turned ON now)
- Included two new internal CD-ROM plugins : One for WinNT/Win2k users,
  which uses WinNT/Win2k's native functions, and an ASPI CD-ROM plugin
  for Win9x and Win2k users, which is usually faster than the older plugins.
- Fixes to XA sound playback in the internal SPU plugin.
- Included NTSC/PAL auto detection for a more accurate timing, mainly
  in Square videos.
- The ISOs are loaded directly now, without showing the BIOS logo. 
- Added support for PSX mouse emulation. (Selectable in Config -> Controller)(*)
- Added support for PSX analog pad emulation using Analog Pads or mouse.
  (selectable in Config- > Controller)(*)
- It's now possible to disable the pads; this is necessary for some games which
  are only playable for 1 player. (qbert)
- Included a new memory card selector, which comes with support for the most
  important memory card formats (.MCR, .MEM, .MCD, .GME)
- Memory cards are saved now when you go to the main window and when you exit
  the emu incorrectly. It's still highly recommended though to close down the
  emu using the File -> Exit option ;-)
- Added an experimental "Change discs" option. To switch a disc, you need to
  go to File -> Change disc. (this isn't working with some games yet though)
- ePSXe should work better with Lewpy's plugins now, so no more crashes when
  you exit the emu. The reset/continue functions should also work now on several
  videoboards.
- Fixes to the CD-ROM decoder and the core, which make some more games playable
  like for example Final Fantasy 9, Grandia, Fear Effect, Tenchu 2 and so on ;-)
- Added a snapshot maker in key F8. (you need the "snap" directory).
- Since we haven't been able to fix the Chrono Cross bug yet, we added a workaround,
  which can be activated using the F3 key while the game freezes at that point 
  (though this doesn't fix the status screen problem yet, you must still use the
  cheat code for this)


(*) We have created a system, where you can either use one digital pad and one
mouse or one analog pad. You can change between those using the F5 key.
We contacted the GPU plugin authors, so in the next version of their plugins, there 
should be a flag displaying the type of pad you have currently selected.
