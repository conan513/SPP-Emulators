This mod is based on a simplification of the fps++ mod by Xalphenos; it drops
dynamic FPS to prevent graphics judder. The Rajkosto "best fence" method
is also included for performance and stability. Judder was easily noticeable
when Link paraglides; the caveat is that one must pick a target FPS which 
they can maintain.

It improves over previous static mods in that it allows ANY positive integer 
as a static fps target and it includes the stamina fix. I've also figured out 
a fix for the physics of arrow projectiles.

To use it enable the graphic pack and choose a preset fps target, or edit
the rules.txt file to add a new preset.
