This mod is based on a simplification of the fps++ mod by Xalphenos; it drops
dynamic FPS to keep behavior closer to the default game. The Rajkosto "best
 fence" method is also included for performance and stability.

It improves over previous static mods in that it allows ANY positive integer 
as a static fps target and it includes the stamina fix. I've also figured out 
a fix for the physics of arrow projectiles.

To use it enable the graphic pack and choose a preset fps target, or edit
the rules.txt file to add a new preset.
