This pack can be used to change the color of (most) glowing objects in the game, including the Sheikah Towers, Shrines (inside and outside), bombs, and others.
The pack is designed to take advantage of the duality of the main colors. It is intended to be customizable.
On each and every shader you will find values you can adjust. My suggestion is to use any tool that can search and replace in multiple files and use the same parameters in all files.
Be aware that some shaders affect both the "On" and the "Off" color of some objects (ex: the open/closed chests in shrines)
Also be aware that this pack changes the color of most lights as well, including orange lights that are not affiliated with the "Off" concept. This is unintended, but I can't do anything about it.
The default configuration uses a red/green combination of colors.
Here are some other example values for HUE_ROTATION, with the respective result
  0	blue/orange
  60	pink/lime
 135	red/green
 200	yellow/cyan
 270	green/magenta
 330	cyan/pink
